      <p>The game of cricket goes long back to British times. When it was introduced in India, very few people played this game. The Maharaja of Patiala, Bhupinder Singh brought this game into limelight. He was a great patron of sports. He played cricket and he had his own team. Cricket was his second love after his kingdom. He was the man behind the golden history of cricket due to his passion for the game. His team Patiala XI was the best team during that time and he was the captain of the Indian team. He himself sponsored his teams for the tours to England.</p>

          <p>Abraham Benjamin de Villiers (born 17 February 1984) is a South African former international cricketer, and a current commentator. AB de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year[2] three times during his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.[3] He is regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the sport and as one of the best batsmen of his era.[4][5] de Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Regarded as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, de Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.[6] He made his international debut in a Test match against England in 2004 and first played a One Day International (ODI) in early 2005.</p>
